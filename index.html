                        ELSE Lasker-Schüler, an eccentric yet imaginative poet and artist, is highlighted in today's Google Doodle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Described as a "key figure in Berlin's bohemian circles", the Jewish German was assaulted by vile Nazi thugs at the age of 64.

                    <h2>
                        Who was Else Lasker-Schüler?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Born in Elberfeld on February 11, 1869, Elisabeth Schüler was raised in a prominent Jewish family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homeschooled by her mum, she was encouraged to experiment and explore her artistic interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, she began to develop her voice as a poet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1894, Schüler married Jonathan Lasker and moved to Berlin, where she later published her first poems.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her work has themes of romantic and sexual longing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She became a well-known fixture in Berlin’s artistic circles, rubbing elbows in cafes with some of the city’s top literary figures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bringing her vivid work to life, the eccentric Lasker-Schüler could be found dressed in flamboyant robes, assuming the alter ego of one of her vibrant characters - Jusuf, Prince of Thebes, who is depicted in today's Doodle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She would, for example, appear as an Egyptian boy or Persian girl.

                    <h2>
                        Why is Google Doodle celebrating her?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Lasker-Schüler is widely considered one of the greatest lyricists to write in the German language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this day in 1937, a Swiss newspaper published her famous poem Mein blaues Klavier - translated as My Blue Piano.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is referenced in today’s Doodle artwork by the piano keys depicted on the camel’s back, alongside other symbols of Lasker-Schüler's life and work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Times of Israel says that in 1933, she was beaten in the street by Nazis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The horrendous assault prompted her to flee Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, she didn't share her departure plans with mates, and was declared a "missing person" until she was eventually tracked down in Switzerland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the final years of her life in Jerusalem, Lasker-Schüler was poor, suffered from bad health and felt isolated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "She was often seen feeding street cats and birds while talking to them," says the Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her final collection of poems was My Blue Piano - she died in 1945, and was buried in Mt Olives.

                        What is a Google Doodle?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1998, Google founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second 'o' of Google to show they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.

                                        This is a stupid article.  Most of the tax on alcohol is applied by the British, not the French - that is it is so much cheaper in France than it is here.
